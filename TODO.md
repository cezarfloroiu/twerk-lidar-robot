### Initial poking around
- [x] upload code to Teensy
  - [x] try moving a servo
- [ ] interface with MPU-9250
- [ ] interface with single point lidar

### Design
- [ ] mathematically determine ideal max weight of robot
- [ ] design body for servo placement
- [ ] placement of parts based on size/wiring

### Modeling
- [ ] create 3D world/mockup of robot
- [ ] simulate the navigation

### Telemetry
- [ ] with ESP-01 send back data to remote thing that can create 3D world of what robot perceives
