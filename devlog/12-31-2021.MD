Trying again, going to see if I can get this IMU to work.

Been a bit don't remember what I was doing.

Looks like I was trying to connect the IMU to the Teensy 4 using `SCL` and `SDA` which are...

`SCL` - serial clock

`SDA` - serial data

There are two different `Arduino` programmers? `Teensyduino`... huh.

Well that uploaded fine so that's good.

It's funny like I don't really know what to do, somehow I need to get data off this `IMU` into the `Teensy`.

I'm following this page here, not sure yet if I want to use i2c or spi, I've used i2c before

https://github.com/bolderflight/mpu9250/blob/main/examples/arduino/i2c/i2c.ino

I'm just going to run their code as is and then understand how it works/how I can turn it into a module.

Quick reading on i2c vs. spi

I see i2c uses the SDA and SCK lines, SPI needs 4 lines and can save wires for other devices.

The speed not sure when I'll know enough to tell.

Well let's just run it and see what happens.

Ha that's neat, this `eigen.h` was added 2 weeks ago, need to add it.

I'm using full paths to these places for now, won't be tracked since I'm not tracking the libraries folder (other people's repos)

`undefined reference read` wonder if it needs to be on. Nope something else.

Need to check if I'm using the right pins. Nope using wrong ones.

I'll be using the outer most set (have two) `17 -> SDA1` and `16 -> SCL1`

I had a thought that I'll use one of these proto boards with a socket setup for the Teensy 4. Then the actual stuff like sensor(s), servos, etc will be soldered to the outer board.

Hmm not working... I will just try and use the example file directly vs. re-making it with imported stuff.

Same issue `undefined reference to `bfs::Mpu9250::Read()`

IMU is getting power... checking wires again maybe wrong pings.

Well the connection check in setup doesn't fire so I guess it's good.

It's failing in the loop. Lol I've looked at this SO link before for `ld returned 1 exit status`

Yuck... typing on a keyboard + flux from soldering is nasty.

Oh... no I'm stuck at the setup lol, imu is not defined somehow

Seems like I might be missing some resistors huh.

I should note I have a box of shame of dead rpis lol learning is hard

I'm sorry little one as this Teensy explodes

Well that did not help attaching those pull up resistors.

Hmm I am using 5V to power the IMU wonder if that matters.

I'm about to be like reeeee and use an Arduino instead just to get going.

I'll leave those resistors unplugged for now till I can get past this undefined software problem.

Ahh... sadness.

Crying meme

Ahh... man this sucks. Soy tonto. Why doesn't it just work man Javascript.

So I'm taking apart the example code, `bfs::Mpu9250` does exist, gets imported right. I think it's the mapping from the function calls in the header that I'm importing and the `CPP` file the header uses to define those functions.

[Gondor calls for aid](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70543385/functions-defined-in-cpp-file-not-available-when-called-from-header-file)! I always feel like a dunce asking for help ahh...

Well that's SO for you, instantly closed. Leaves such distaste I feel like I'm in trouble or something.

Not like I didn't try.

Oh well history has been written down votes are in. This is why hardware is hard (no pun).

I don't know what `imu` is here. Is it a random word?

`bfs::Mpu9250 imu(&Wire, 0x68);`

I thought it's a function or instantiation of that class but where does the word `imu` come from.

Alright I'm going to ask the actual makers/people of Teensy lol to help me. There is so much to do for this project I can't get stuck on how to use an IMU.

Anyway worst case, I will use these other things I bought. I bought STM32, beagle bone, blue pill... I also have another Arduino Nano somewhere.

At this time I'm not super concerned with the hardware itself I am more concerned with writing the software that will build a 3D world/track and navigate itself.

Oh yeah blue pill is STM32 I see.

I think I just had a case of not RTFM

I don't know why I tried to use CMAKE before (3 months ago) and not just go with the Arduino route.

I guess it's just been too easy regarding `$npm install small-loan-of-a-million-dollars`

We're back on track, I got [help](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/69120-Another-Teensy-4-0-and-MPU9250-thread?p=296684), from the library creator himself too crazy.

Now I have to remember which of these 9-axis sensors I have isn't crap where G is stuck at -7 or whatever.

I'm feeling it... I'm free. FREE!!! Momentarily anyway.

Next thing I have to do is interface with that small cheal single point lidar.

Then I'll start designing the body/"circuit board".

I will use math for the lever arm on the legs and what not, make sure it doesn't suck.

I also was thinking about making the legs modular so I can swap them out/do stuff.

Fire up the 3D printer that my cat uses to toast his buns.

I have to find that single point lidar actually. I bought them months ago.

Crap I don't know what these units are I was just looking for 1 for 1G

Well it looks like the good ones I have just judging from moving/responding columns are: 2B (orange cap) and 1B

I do have some 6050's and I don't know if magnetometer will help me at this time, just a ground insect robot working in an apt, just need velocity/accel and roll.

Interesting accel is in m/s^2

Lol 8m/s^2 yeah that's not right... wonder if there is a calibration thing.

-81 lol that's even worse

Recompiling seems to help.

WTF 156 what is this...

2B doesn't work

1B is good at -10
2B orange cap, -8

I think actually a few ground pins are bad on my breadboard

Or they're just super bad like the 156 one

Oh man my fingers are nasty... this flux...

I found my orders, I have one new 9250 let's see how that does.

I have to solder these parts.

I'm feeling it. I'm pumped to make this thing.

-7 lol you have failed me!

I'm also getting progressively f'd up. I'm #3 in which isn't much but yeah.

Anyway I know hardware isn't perfect and software should adapt.

Trying to interface with the Lidar module now, who will I cry to next.

Interesting, I should connect with both devices at the same time after I try it out, as I do want to save pins.

This is great though, also I2C same pins... going with the Pololu library.

Will this just work? Let's see

Freaking metric man, but it works so cool.

Oh no it says 2 meters max sensing distance but it's only seeing 2 inches away what... hmm

Lol it's like "you're angry because you bought cheap crap?"

Hmm it got better readings pointing at something other than the flab on my body.

Yeah I'm pretty satisfied with this.

I'm going to model some more parts and start designing this thing physically.
