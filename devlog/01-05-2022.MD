Back In Black starts playing by ACDC

Oh man... got through something hard... now going to do some work on this. Trying to keep the fire alive, this project is my reward.

I'm getting excited for the math aspect of this, applying physics to a 3D coordinate system that'll be neat.

I think I mentioned I want to split the printing up into smaller parts.

Might be stupid to print it this way but I wanted to keep the center part as solid as possible (regarding supports).

There will be a top layer that "snaps" onto the frame with some glue and that will hold up the IMU/top board.

I am still trying to figure out how to align the ToF sensor with the IMU.

I decided to print these "servo booties" if you will that connect to the base of the servo with these pegs so that it makes the wish-bone design.

This is printing so well now... I might not even bother taking the printer apart ha despite having ordered parts.

The mat is deifnitely good though.

Ahh man... the feed gear was slipping. I heard it make a weird noise, dang.

I might have spoken too soon about the print head stuff, it failed at the heating element so yeah...

Ehh it's not great but will work/something to start with.
