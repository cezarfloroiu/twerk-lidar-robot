Back at it again. I'm going to commit to this these next two days. I want to get the physical thing built and then work on programming whatever over time.

I'm going to try this black filament I bought, the white filament seems too finicky to print right now, I may even go back to this ugly purple-grey I was using before.

Well... paid all my bills, even more broke, back to this.

There is one thing I have not done yet which is use an ESP-01 to talk with the Teensy.

Oh yeah it should [just work](https://www.instructables.com/I2C-With-the-ESP8266-01-Exploring-ESP8266Part-1/) as i2c as well.

I'll steal old code I worked on where the ESP-01 is used as a websocket server to connect to, the tablet controller will connect to it to get the telemetry.
