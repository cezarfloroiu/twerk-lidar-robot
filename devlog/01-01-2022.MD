Back at it again. I'm going to commit to this these next two days. I want to get the physical thing built and then work on programming whatever over time.

I'm going to try this black filament I bought, the white filament seems too finicky to print right now, I may even go back to this ugly purple-grey I was using before.

Well... paid all my bills, even more broke, back to this.

There is one thing I have not done yet which is use an ESP-01 to talk with the Teensy.

Oh yeah it should [just work](https://www.instructables.com/I2C-With-the-ESP8266-01-Exploring-ESP8266Part-1/) as i2c as well.

I'll steal old code I worked on where the ESP-01 is used as a websocket server to connect to, the tablet controller will connect to it to get the telemetry.

Interesting how long it takes to write to the ESP-01.

Oh dang I have to find it now on the network.

I'll prove the communication works by blinking an LED on the Teensy from a web interface.

I'm hoping the ESP-01 can run off the Teensy's 3.3V pin says it has 250mA out which is a transmitting consumption of ESP-01 I believe.

Otherwise I would need a 3V down regulator and I'm trying to avoid that since I'm boosting up from 3.7V.

I think I found the ESP... need to get a basic websocket client going to test.

I'm stealing some old code again that I had from the [not-quite-an-ant-robot](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/not-quite-an-ant-robot/blob/master/websocket-test/websocket-client.js) project which is what made me want to build a legit robot with 3D world awareness.

Oh yeah as I suspected this is not meant for web/straight html... will adapt one from MDN.

Hmm socket test not working not sure what's up.

This loop is not continuing oddly, yeap my code was breaking the poll hmm.

Not sure why I put this 1 minute poll in for. The old robot controller does work, so that's odd.

Idk why I made this piece of crap in the past, the readme example makes more sense.

I just had a funny video idea for this project when it's done, true to the name.

It's weird it gets stock in the loop, doesn't advance.

It can't connect from the web to the ESP either... hmm.

Oh there is one other basic thing I need to do, is to have more than one thing connected to the same i2c wires and check that I can distinguish/address each thing individually.

Oh... I wonder if it's like the app has to run from an IP not localhost/direct on a file.

No change hmm...

Tried it on my desktop, finally got an error, says connection closed hmm.

Oh damn... using wrong ip... misread the lines dumb ass.

Man I don't want to touch these electronic components they're covered in grease.

See the lines are consuming to my feable mind... assumed the 187 is a Pi not ESP.

The shenzhen one is a usb wifi adapter, pretty cool tech on my Pi Zero non-wireless.

Oof wasted an hour on that oh well.

Now I'm going to parallel wire an MPU9250 and ESP01 to make sure I can separate them. I'll later come up with a circuit to join all these, will have to solder it all together.

Finish the body and then start programming the gates and what not.

Build the "world system" that'll be pretty cool.

I have to think about this how the web will talk to ESP-01 to Teensy and sensor to get that data back out.

I think for the ESP01 I have to use the other set of i2c wires due to the 3.3V power constraint.

I'll need those 2K Ohm pull ups for this i2c line.

Alright I've got the IMU and ESP connected, now I need to apify-abstracitfy everything so it can just be used like a method.

It starts with... `VOID SETUP` I don't know why... ha sorry RIP

Crap looks like Teensy doesn't provide enough current for the ESP to run on.

I think I will design the board to have a voltage thing to measure battery's voltage. The battery is the protected type built in but still, that would be neat.

Plenty of analog lines. Can commit left side of the Teensy to controll all 12 servos.

Yeah... sucks but I'll connect the 18650 to a step up and a 3V linear down regulator for the ESP to use.
