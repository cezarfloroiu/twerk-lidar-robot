So this is a rare day where I work back to back... my sleep pattern's reversed right now so I need to flip it where I sleep at night and awake in the day time.

I'm currently designing the laser pointer holder that I will print in the morning.

Hehe this is quite a sight.

What will be interesting is the real math where I have to somehow store x,y,z points from the samples... although initially they will just be depth. I don't have real positioning yet until I actually use the IMU.

No... I'm not going to print this, I need to do this now. I will use a wire from a ground flag marker thing.

I have a whole stack of them but I can't find one. Found one

Yeah this will work for an approximation. I'm going to put a delay per command to see it more/exaggerate.

It kinda looks like a tank. Those are cool designs, 86!

Well look at that, two pieces of wire and we're good. This is not that accurate but good visual of what's happening.

Scan dimensions: 19.25" by 8.75" at a distance of 31.5"

One good thing from this is I realized my sensoring area is a wide AR/rectangle as opposed to a square, makes sense, it tilts up less than sweeps.

This is not that accurate because the laser while not perfectly straight, is also sticking far ahead of the center of the robot.

Still... it is supposed to be somewhat right since the beam is going along this line.

Oh yeah... I have a 3D model of this thing because I made every part...

I'm pretty sure this STL is broken but I want to see it on Github.
