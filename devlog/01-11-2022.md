Alright, let's get this thing moving.

Looks like I was using an enum to get a servo by shorthand. Then using a "global looper" to coordinate the servos together.

Man I can't think, I just want to get this thing moving so I will steal the code I wrote before.

This is pretty cool:

Lol it won't stop shaking... the front-right-inner servo.

This is actually hard, I can't get it to stand up on three legs if one just goes up.

I think the same side leg that's not moving has to increase it's pitch to tilt the robot towards the side it's rising on. At the same time the moving servo is moving.

It's drawing around 450 mA in the standing position, wider base.

Current draw is climbing... it's at 0.7 A now, servos getting louder. Lift it up back down to 200mA range.

Ugh... I will replace this servo, it keeps twitching/annoying me. It's the front-right-inner unfortunately. Not as bad as a middle one I guess.

I have to print a new boot because it's glued on. So far programming is not going well haha... I have to use the dynamic balancing for the gait... it should expect to fall into the step I think.

Alright servo boot printed, I reassembled it.

The top part of the servo arm assembly where you put a screw down is weak, it split on the front right arm.

Should increase the thickness of that, since the screw has plenty of room to go into the actual servo arm.

I'm using glue and a random piece of plastic to add strength to where it snapped.

Yeah... this is not working.

This is not working well... crazy too when it drags the legs against the carpet, the current draw spiked to 1.5A.

I want to get somewhere as the power supply will come in tomorrow. Then I can run commands wirelessly by a websocket client.
