Alright, let's get this thing moving.

Looks like I was using an enum to get a servo by shorthand. Then using a "global looper" to coordinate the servos together.

Man I can't think, I just want to get this thing moving so I will steal the code I wrote before.

This is pretty cool:

// gif of zero position

Lol it won't stop shaking... the front-right-inner servo.

This is actually hard, I can't get it to stand up on three legs if one just goes up.

I think the same side leg that's not moving has to increase it's pitch to tilt the robot towards the side it's rising on. At the same time the moving servo is moving.

It's drawing around 450 mA in the standing position, wider base.
