Printing again, I remember on the last robot I had to make this looper thing for moving all the servos together.

Also I had problems with parameters, they had to be specified not passed in on the fly/whatever you wanted.

I'll steal that to work off of, but I imagine it will be modified if the IMU overrides it (like it's falling or something).

I like at my old code and I'm like "oof" but I also don't know how to write it cleaner right now.

Got the middle part reprinted for the back-right arm. Assembling it now.

There are two sides to cheap: cool it's cheap or damn it it's cheap.

I am annoyed with these cheap servos because I just dread the thought of it stripping... but also this robot could cost 2-4x if I bought more expensive stuff.

The servos are twitching and it's freaking me out.

It's a good thing these arms have good flex, I have to stretch the middle one out to go over the boot.
