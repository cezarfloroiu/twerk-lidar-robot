Printing again, I remember on the last robot I had to make this looper thing for moving all the servos together.

Also I had problems with parameters, they had to be specified not passed in on the fly/whatever you wanted.

I'll steal that to work off of, but I imagine it will be modified if the IMU overrides it (like it's falling or something).

I like at my old code and I'm like "oof" but I also don't know how to write it cleaner right now.
