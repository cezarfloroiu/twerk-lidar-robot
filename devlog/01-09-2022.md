Printing again, I remember on the last robot I had to make this looper thing for moving all the servos together.

Also I had problems with parameters, they had to be specified not passed in on the fly/whatever you wanted.

I'll steal that to work off of, but I imagine it will be modified if the IMU overrides it (like it's falling or something).

I like at my old code and I'm like "oof" but I also don't know how to write it cleaner right now.

Got the middle part reprinted for the back-right arm. Assembling it now.

There are two sides to cheap: cool it's cheap or damn it it's cheap.

I am annoyed with these cheap servos because I just dread the thought of it stripping... but also this robot could cost 2-4x if I bought more expensive stuff.

The servos are twitching and it's freaking me out.

It's a good thing these arms have good flex, I have to stretch the middle one out to go over the boot.

Yes yes yes it's looking good

I'm happy to finally have used an 18650 "for real".

Ooh was just thinking this could have an induction charger on it. It would just find its home and "lay down".

I did put some super glue on the ToF sensor mounts to make sure it doesn't move after being "center".

Making sure this is right, not backwards, weird hole, etc...

After all it takes 2hrs 41 mins to come out. Well I have that much time to kill so I guess I'll go learn/figure some stuff out.
