Oh no... I saw the outside, it's a perfectly blue sky day... winds acceptible although coming slightly from the wrong direction. Ideal is north wind.

Ahh... I gotta tell myself it's a bad day, bad day to fly.

See below, the ideal direction is north wind. If it's from the NW as it is now, means I launch towards the trees which isn't terrible but then flying backwards it's hard to look at the plane/see what it's doing.

Also if there are no thermals it just sucks... throwing and throwing... I'm thinking the ground will be wet too.

Nope I'm going to go... lol. Let's see if it's a disappointment. It's also rare, should be winter. I will laugh if the park is closed and I can't get in anyway.

I have to charge batteries though. While it is depressing to see a bunch of dead trees, there is something therapeutic to me about a perfectly blue sky.

I'll get some film recorded too. Unfortunately I operate my life with fear too like I don't want to draw attention to myself in this apt complex.

This is why one day I dream of having a like hangar or not a homestead but you know land somewhere isolated. I have room to fly and make things that roam the land.

I did get the new power supply in so when I come back I'll 3D print a mount for that, it will prevent the PCB from flexing too.

Last tube battery is charging for the DLG. I was supposed to design and 3D print these wing holders that attach to the DLG so that it's easier to carry around but haven't gotten around to it.

Today I will get a twerk sample with the "lidar". Whether or not I can mathematically make sense of it is something else.
