Back at it again 8 hrs later or so.

Previously on Twerk Lidar Blues... our host Jacob Cunningham has discovered he messed up the wiring and offset the pins by one... how the Teensy survived, we're unsure. Tune in to find out what happens next...

Oh man... it's so deep too like under layer of wires.

Somehow I lost my solder sucker.

Smoke test... yeap smoke on a servo bus line again. First boot it was good, ESP did it's thing, blue LED not stuck. Afterwards it was stuck, so I'm thinking it has a serial buffer building up (ha).

If I plug the ESP into the programmer it works as normal.

Briefly worked but bad again, after replugged in. I'm hoping it's not a current problem.

It sees the ToF not the IMU. I'll try and power it externally briefly I guess this step up converter has low amperage dang.

A little different behavior but still bad.

Oh no I'm stupid I forgot the bus scanner checks Wire not Wire1 my bad.

Still have the problem of the ESP getting stuck.

I desoldered half the servos too :(

Rx pin goes hot on boot on Teensy

Desoldered rx and tx pins from Teensy, still stuck in red/blue.

Desolder TX pin from ESP01 works...

I think I have it... I'm not entirely sure what I fixed, maybe the TX pin on the ESP was touching ground a little.

Restarted the rig a few times ESP is doing the right thing (blue led blinks a couple times then goes out -- means connected to wifi)

Yes... both sensors outputting and ESP up.

I have to wash off my nasty fingers from soldering.
