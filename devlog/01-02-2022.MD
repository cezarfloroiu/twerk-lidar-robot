Back at it again 8 hrs later or so.

Previously on Twerk Lidar Blues... our host Jacob Cunningham has discovered he messed up the wiring and offset the pins by one... how the Teensy survived, we're unsure. Tune in to find out what happens next...

Oh man... it's so deep too like under layer of wires.

Somehow I lost my solder sucker.

Smoke test... yeap smoke on a servo bus line again. First boot it was good, ESP did it's thing, blue LED not stuck. Afterwards it was stuck, so I'm thinking it has a serial buffer building up (ha).

If I plug the ESP into the programmer it works as normal.

Briefly worked but bad again, after replugged in. I'm hoping it's not a current problem.

It sees the ToF not the IMU. I'll try and power it externally briefly I guess this step up converter has low amperage dang.

A little different behavior but still bad.

Oh no I'm stupid I forgot the bus scanner checks Wire not Wire1 my bad.

Still have the problem of the ESP getting stuck.

I desoldered half the servos too :(

Rx pin goes hot on boot on Teensy

Desoldered rx and tx pins from Teensy, still stuck in red/blue.

Desolder TX pin from ESP01 works...

I think I have it... I'm not entirely sure what I fixed, maybe the TX pin on the ESP was touching ground a little.

Restarted the rig a few times ESP is doing the right thing (blue led blinks a couple times then goes out -- means connected to wifi)

Yes... both sensors outputting and ESP up.

I have to wash off my nasty fingers from soldering

What have we here...

I don't actually use this thing it's not that good and you need good light on what you're looking at.

Some progress pics:

I actually did have a thought, I should check the servos all work before I get too far.

I thought there would be a clash between the 5V in and the USB power during programming but I guess they're like in parallel or something/don't matter which one is on with regard to powering the stuff down stream.

First sign not good, servo's twitching. This is without being programmed.

Now that it's set, it's working, servo 1 sweeping.

Actually I could do a current test power them all lol. I won't though, want to make sure I don't strip them though at this point I have like 50-60 of these servos.

0-5 is good (right side of board)

I do dislike (hate) how servos flip out/strip themselves if not connected/programmed right. This is why I was hesitant in the past to use them with Raspberry Pi/opted to have an Arduino bridge in between.

Looks like servo #11 is problematic hmm.

Oh no ESP having problems again hmm. Powered off for a bit, gone. I wonder if it's the Teensy socket?

Yeah #11 isn't moving interesting.

The problem with my socket for the Teensy is it's made of two parts, vs. a continuous piece. So there's an extra width in there where they join.

I would not advise to do that, I should have realized but it's a PITA to desolder 40 pins and I don't know if I have that part anyway. It's only problematic during programming since the USB can shift the pins. We're good now though, ESP works right, servo 11 is working. Its signal wire was funky.
