Seems like the magnetism on this mat is less, it's easier to move.

I was tapping off the little initial drip line and yeah, the mat just shifted away underneath ugh... cheap shit man that's what you get.

Ha yeap the reviews say the same thing... tragic. You think a mat... that can't be something you screw up right? Wrong... lol magentized wrong way, not strong enough, peels apart, etc...

Will see how long it lasts.

Ugh these greasy servos.

I'm going hungryyyyyyyyyyy (no I'm not I'm fat currently)
