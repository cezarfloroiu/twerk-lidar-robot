Alright, new day, same me.

Damn it was nice outside, cold just under 20 F but was sunny.

Oh yeah new heating bed.

Fantasy of mine, make an app for the Pinephone to control this thing.

It has a nice grip, makes me want to...

### GET ON THE GROUND!!!

Look at this, what a pro, putting on markers to mark the direction of the legs.

Nope forget it I'm not doing it... this thing is not meant to be reproduced by anyone.

I will label the files at least.

Oh my god the chorus of Would by AIC

Going through this batch of parts I printed last night and fixing what was wrong with them.

Seems like the magnetism on this mat is less, it's easier to move.

I was tapping off the little initial drip line and yeah, the mat just shifted away underneath ugh... cheap shit man that's what you get.

Ha yeap the reviews say the same thing... tragic. You think a mat... that can't be something you screw up right? Wrong... lol magentized wrong way, not strong enough, peels apart, etc...

Will see how long it lasts.

Ugh these greasy servos.

I'm going hungryyyyyyyyyyy (no I'm not I'm fat currently)

Lol Evenflow song breeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaathinnnnnnnnnnn a;fjals;kjfasklfjaskfjsd

Pretty accurate how that song goes.

Got the new arm print, going to check if the servo boots are good as is. I'll print at 30% infill see if that's strong enough without changing the design.

Ha the magnetization is the wrong way, I cut the tab off so now looks like this.

Checking out the latest outer arm print.

If possible today I'll get this assembled and maybe take its first step. I'm skeptical because each part takes 30mins to 1hr and there are 20 parts to print.

Well it is a bit early but I think I will start working on the "world coordinate system".

It's funny I actually studied phs/eng in school but I didn't finish, once I got into quantum was like nah... I'm too stupid for that.

One of the main things I should be able to do is move the thing 11" and stop, then see that on a remote display (via live stream telemetry).

Servo boot print done let me check. Ugh immediately broke a side guide, that'll have to grow. The outer arm has to shrink in height. Nope I won't do that, don't need to reprint this arm. I will extend the boot shims.

The inner-most arm is too tight height wise, need to increase it.

Oof 1hr 43min test print still aye...
