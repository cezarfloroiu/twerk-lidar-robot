I'm going to study the current walking gait briefly.

It was set to slow in the previous videos, it is a little better when set to be faster eg. it's at 4 ms now vs. 6.
Fastest would be 1 ms.

I'm fine with it being slow while I first work on it.

It seems wrong that it does this "pull all legs forward" as the last step.

I do notice, it barely moves the legs forward... I'll see the stability of the balance but I think it can go further.

Here specifically:
