Print the body again, this time it won't be cut in half.

Print servo boots first using old dimensions not extended.

Then print a full set of legs without the boots (should be printed in batch).

I do already see flaws with the current arm design, particularly in maximum throw... the arms run into each other so they can only extend say 70-80% of full servo movement.

Omg why is it not a solid... lmao

Oh... that's great I exported it out as something else.

I'm going to print some stuff, try do some job work for a bit before going into the programming of the gaits.

I should be able to work on the one set of legs I have now.

Lol had super glue on my finger tip, attached to the keyboard like oop nope don't want that.

Did some work, the chasis is almost done so I can start working on the gaits while I print out the rest of the legs... I do need a set of servo boots reprinted at 30% infill though.

Ahh man two servo boots take an hour to print damn.
